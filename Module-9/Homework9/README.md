### Kodeco iOS Bootcamp Module 9 Homework Assignment

Module 9's homework required us to create an app from scratch to query the Pexels picture API and had some specific requirements for parts 2 & 3.

#### _Part 2 Requirements_

[âœ“] The appâ€™s main screen should display the results (none on the first start) and a search bar.

[âœ“] When the user taps the enter key on the keyboard, the app should display the results.

[âœ“] When the user taps on one of the results, the app should display another screen and download the image in the background.

[âœ“] The user can return to the search screen by clicking the back button.

[âœ“] A model is used to decode the JSON returned from the API.

[âœ“] A Store object that performs the fetching of the JSON and images.

[âœ“] A view with a search box that displays the search results.

[âœ“] A view that displays the image selected by the user.

[âœ“] Async/Await must be used, and the images must be downloaded in the background.

[âœ“] Display the large or large2x versions of the photos.

- Note: Medium images are used for the search view, while the large2x version is downloaded for the detail view.

#### _Part 3 Requirements_

[âœ“] Show a progress indicator when downloading the images.

- Note: A progress indicator is shown when downloading the large detail image.

#### _Additional Non-Requirement Features_

[âœ“] Used the new Observation Framework in iOS 17+. 

[âœ“] Tried to add some styling to create a more unique app appearance (I am definately not a designer!! ðŸ¤ª)

[âœ“] Added a custom handwriting font.

[âœ“] Took measures to ensure the Pexels API key was not hardcoded into the app:

    - The user must enter the API key in the app; or
    - Developers can enter the API key as an Environment Variable for easy use with Canvas and Simulator.

[âœ“] Ability to continue searching to the next page of photos (if available).

[âœ“] Followed the Pexels API guidelines with appropriate attribution on search and photo pages (with clickable links to the Pexels website).

[âœ“] Launch screen.

[âœ“] Used an asset catalog with autogenerated color names for color constants.

[âœ“] Created an App Icon (with assistance from Illustrator with AI).

[âœ“] Customised the progress bar (using an animation of the Owl from the App's icon).

~~[âœ“] Created a generic SwiftUI-only "zoomable" view - that can scale contained content using a pinch gesture.~~

- ~~Note: This is buggier than I would like and somewhat difficult to implement quite nicely in SwiftUI. If I were to ship this in production, I would actually wrap a UIKit UIScrollView and use the built-in `zoomScale` properties and gestures to create a more robust (and more easily implemented) solution.~~

[âœ“] As I was unhappy with the previously implemented "native" SwiftUI ZoomView, I reimplemented a generic SwiftUI "zoomable" view wrapped around UIKit's UIScrollView. This has removed the glitches that I was unhappy with and created a more robust implementation. This new generic zoomable view is called `ZoomableView`. The previous "native" SwiftUI implementation has been kept in the code for reference as `ZoomView`.

[âœ“] Used the average background color provided by the Pexels photo object for placeholders while downloading in the search view and as part of the background gradient in the detail view.
